## Introduction

This project delves into the realm of data analysis and querying using Oracle SQL. Through a series of tasks, various SQL operations including Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), Data Control Language (DCL), and Transaction Control Language (TCL) are performed on different datasets. The project is structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of SQL querying techniques and their application in real-world scenarios.

## Project Overview

### Task 1: Analysis of Station Data
**Dataset:** STATION  
**Description:** The STATION table contains information about different stations including latitude and longitude.  
**Questions Addressed:**
1. **Execute a query to look at the STATION table in undefined order.**
2. **Execute a query to select Northern stations (Northern latitude > 39.7).**
3. **Execute a query to display temperature stats (from the STATS table) for each city (from the STATION table).**

### Task 2: Analysis of Triangle Data
**Dataset:** TRIANGLES  
**Description:** The TRIANGLES table contains information about different triangles including side lengths.  
**Questions Addressed:**
1. **Write a query to create the TRIANGLES table.**
2. **Write queries to obtain specific information from the table:**
   - Obtain the sum of side_A of all triangles.
   - Obtain an equilateral triangle from the table.
   - Obtain an isosceles triangle from the table.
   - Find the number of triangles in the table.
   - Find the length of side_B of Triangle 3.

### Task 3: Analysis of Employee Data
**Dataset:** EMPLOYEES  
**Description:** The EMPLOYEES table contains information about employees including their names and salaries.  
**Questions Addressed:**
1. **Count the total number of employees.**
2. **Find the salary of Rahul.**
3. **Set Amit’s months to 12.**
4. **Find the sum of salaries of all employees.**
5. **Find the number of employees whose name starts with ‘A’.**

## Conclusion

This project serves as a practical demonstration of SQL querying techniques applied to diverse datasets. Through the analysis of station data, triangle data, and employee data, various SQL operations are performed to extract meaningful insights and answer specific questions. By completing this project, a foundational understanding of SQL and its application in data analysis is acquired, which is invaluable for roles in business analysis and related fields.
